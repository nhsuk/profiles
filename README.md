## Environment variables

Environment variables are expected to be managed by the environment in which
the application is being run. This is best practice as described by
[twelve-factor](https://12factor.net/config).

| Variable                         | Description                                                        | Default               |
|:---------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| `NODE_ENV`                       | node environment                                                   | development           |
| `LOG_LEVEL`                      | numeric [log level](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan#levels)  | Depends on `NODE_ENV` |
| `PORT`                           | server port                                                        | 3000                  |
| `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_TRACKING_ID`   | [Google Analytics](https://www.google.co.uk/analytics) property id |                       |
| `WEBTRENDS_ANALYTICS_TRACKING_ID`| [Webtrends](https://www.webtrends.com/) tracking id                |                       |
| `HOTJAR_ANALYTICS_TRACKING_ID`   | [Hotjar](https://www.hotjar.com/) tracking id                      |                       |

## Working on the application

Start by cloning the repo and all submodules i.e.
`git clone https://github.com/nhsuk/profiles.git && cd profiles/ && git submodule update --init --recursive`

Next, check out the set of scripts for getting the application running
[`scripts`](scripts/)

## Architecture Decision Records

This repo uses
[Architecture Decision Records](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)
to record architectural decisions for this project.
They are stored in [doc/architecture/decisions](doc/architecture/decisions).
